Summary of Key Insights
Based on the comprehensive analysis of gaming and mental health data, here are the major findings:

1. Gaming Addiction Risk Factors
Daily gaming hours is the strongest predictor of addiction risk
Mental health issues (withdrawal symptoms, loss of interests, continuing despite problems) are highly correlated with severe addiction
Social isolation scores increase significantly with gaming intensity

2. Impact on Physical Health
Higher gaming hours are associated with:
Reduced sleep hours and poor sleep quality
Increased prevalence of eye strain and back/neck pain

Disrupted sleep patterns

3. Impact on Mental Health
Strong correlation between gaming hours and:
Social isolation (positive correlation)

Mood instability and anxiety
Withdrawal symptoms when not gaming

4. Academic/Work Performance
Extreme gaming (6+ hours daily) is associated with:
Lower GPA scores
Reduced work productivity
Higher rates of below-average performance

5. Genre-Specific Patterns
Different game genres show varying risk levels
MMO and MOBA games tend to have higher average gaming hours
Mobile games show varied patterns depending on game type
