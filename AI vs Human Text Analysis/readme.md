**AI vs Human Text Detection Analysis**

Project Overview
This project analyzes the AuthentiText dataset containing 1,000 text samples labeled as either AI-generated or human-written. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning classification, and insights into distinguishing characteristics between AI and human text.

**Dataset Features**:

text_id: Unique identifier for each text sample
content_text: The actual text content
author_type: AI or Human (target variable)
model_source: Source model (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Human)
Linguistic Features:
prompt_complexity_score
perplexity_score
burstiness_index
syntactic_variability
semantic_coherence_score
lexical_diversity_ratio
readability_grade_level
generation_confidence_score

**Key Objectives**:

- Analyze linguistic patterns in AI vs human text
- Identify key features that distinguish AI from human writing
- Build classification models to detect AI-generated content
- Compare different AI models' characteristics
- Provide insights for content authenticity verification
